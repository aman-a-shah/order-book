# A deterministic allocator

A hybrid **slab + TLSF** allocator that serves every `malloc`/`free` in constant
worst-case time, runs lock-free across threads, and partitions one user-space
`mmap` region between two purpose-built engines. Every figure on this page is
rendered from a live run.

| Throughput vs malloc (slab) | Allocation latency, p99.9 | Fragmentation | Worst-case time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **4.5×** | **167 ns** | **0.24%** | **O(1)** |

**Fig. 1 — Allocation-latency distribution over the full HFT trace (log–log).**
The custom allocator (crimson) collapses onto a narrow band; the system
allocator (slate, dashed) carries a long right tail of multi-microsecond
outliers. **Determinism — not peak speed — is the whole point of a custom
allocator here.** (Distribution data is summarized in Tbl. 1.)

At startup the allocator reserves one large contiguous region from the OS with
`mmap(MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS)` and manages it entirely in user space — no
kernel transitions on the critical path. A size router splits each request
between two engines tuned for the two allocation shapes a trading system actually
produces: a flood of **fixed-size records** (orders, executions, ticks) and a
smaller stream of **variable-length** ingestion buffers. A lock-free thread layer
then replicates the pair per core.

**Pipeline:** `00` OS arena (`mmap` region, bump-carved into superblocks) →
`01` **Size router** (≤256 B fixed → slab; else → TLSF) →
`02a` Slab pool (intrusive free-list, zero header) →
`02b` TLSF matrix (bitmap good-fit + coalescing).

> **isolation →** each thread owns a private slab + TLSF arena, carved from the
> shared region with one atomic compare-and-swap. The hot path takes no locks and
> no syscalls; a block freed by another thread is queued lock-free to its owner
> and reclaimed on that owner's next allocation — never touched in place.

## 01 · Dual-engine architecture

The two engines never compete for the same request, and neither pays the
general-purpose overhead the other would impose.

### Slab engine — fixed-size records

Each slab pool pre-carves a block into identical slots. A free slot stores the
"next free" pointer *inside its own memory* (an intrusive free-list), so
allocation and deallocation are single pointer swaps with **zero per-object
header** — live allocations are raw pointers, which keeps cache lines dense and
alignment intact. Routing a free back to the right engine without a header is
solved by an address-range registry rather than a tag byte.

### TLSF engine — variable sizes in O(1)

For variable requests a linear free-list search would inject O(N) jitter. The
Two-Level Segregated Fit engine instead maps a size to an exact *(first-level,
second-level)* bin coordinate by bit math: a coarse power-of-two class, then a
linear subdivision into 32 sub-bins that bounds internal waste.

$$ f=\big\lfloor \log_2 s \big\rfloor, \qquad s_2=\left\lfloor \frac{s-2^{f}}{2^{\,f-L}} \right\rfloor, \qquad L=\log_2 \mathrm{SL}=5 $$

A two-level bitmap marks which bins are non-empty. Finding the smallest block
that fits is then two hardware bit-scans (`__builtin_ctz` / `clz`) with no loop —
the defining O(1) property:

$$ \text{bin} \;=\; \operatorname{ctz}\!\Big(\,\mathrm{SL}_f \,\wedge\, (\,{\sim}0 \ll s_2)\,\Big) $$

On `free`, boundary tags let the engine inspect both physical neighbours and
**immediately coalesce** in either direction, decoupling the merged neighbours
from their bins and re-inserting one larger block — the mechanism that keeps
fragmentation flat (§05).

**TLSF parameters**

| Symbol | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| *α* | 8 B | minimum alignment; all sizes are multiples |
| *SL* | 32 | second-level sub-bins per class (one 32-bit word) |
| *FL* | 25 | first-level power-of-two classes |
| *h* | 16 B | block header (size · flags · prev-phys tag) |

## 02 · Throughput

Each scenario replays the identical allocate/free trace through both allocators.
The fixed-size slab path is the cleanest comparison — pure pointer-swaps against
the system allocator's general-purpose machinery — while the mixed HFT trace
exercises both engines under realistic burst-then-drain churn.

**Fig. 2 — Throughput (million ops/s; higher is better).**

| Workload | memalloc | system malloc | speedup |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| Slab (fixed 64 B) | 98.7 | 22.2 | 4.5× |
| TLSF (variable) | 21.9 | 17.9 | 1.2× |
| HFT mixed | 38.6 | 19.7 | 2.0× |

> **38.6 M ops/s** sustained on the mixed HFT trace — about **2.0×** the system
> allocator, with the fixed-size path reaching **4.5×** and the variable-size
> path **1.2×**. The full `malloc`/`free` round-trip is benchmarked with Google
> Benchmark and cross-checked by the standalone metrics harness.

The advantage comes from doing less work, deterministically: the slab path never
searches, and the TLSF path replaces free-list traversal and the system
allocator's size-class bookkeeping with two bit-scans and a boundary-tag merge.
The platform's libc allocator is a strong, modern baseline — so the gap here is
conservative relative to the classic glibc `ptmalloc` comparison.

## 03 · Latency & determinism

For an execution engine the tail is what matters: a single multi-microsecond
stall during a market burst is a missed fill. Because both allocators clear most
operations inside one timer tick (~41 ns on this host), the body of the
distribution is reported as below-tick and the comparison lives in the tail.

**Tbl. 1 — Per-operation allocation latency by percentile.** memalloc holds a
flat tail while the system allocator's p99.9 and maximum blow out by an order of
magnitude (coalescing, freelist walks, and occasional kernel growth).

| Percentile | memalloc (ns) | system (ns) | tighter |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| p50 | <41 | <41 | — |
| p90 | <41 | 125 | — |
| p99 | 43 | 251 | 5.8× |
| p99.9 | 167 | 1.4K | 8.2× |
| max | 1.7M | 7.2M | 4.2× |

The same flatness holds *across request size* — the operational definition of
O(1). Slab requests are constant by construction; TLSF requests stay constant
because bin selection is two bit-scans regardless of size, where the system
allocator's per-op cost drifts with the size class it lands in.

**Fig. 3 — Mean allocate/free latency vs. request size, 16 B → 64 KB (log x).**
memalloc is flat — O(1) — across four orders of magnitude; the system allocator
is higher and size-dependent.

| Request size | memalloc (ns) | system (ns) |
|---|--:|--:|
| 16 B | 13.0 | 27.0 |
| 32 B | 15.2 | 32.5 |
| 64 B | 13.4 | 39.0 |
| 128 B | 12.3 | 33.9 |
| 256 B | 14.3 | 77.5 |
| 512 B | 19.6 | 81.6 |
| 1 KB | 29.2 | 31.5 |
| 4 KB | 23.2 | 38.8 |
| 16 KB | 29.4 | 42.6 |
| 64 KB | 33.9 | 49.4 |

## 04 · Concurrency & scaling

General-purpose allocators serialize on internal locks; this design removes the
hot path from any shared state. Each thread owns a private, isolated cache — a
full slab+TLSF engine over its own superblock — so allocation and same-thread
free take **no locks and touch no shared memory**. The single point of
synchronization is cold: a per-thread superblock carved from the global region
with one atomic compare-and-swap.

The hard case is freeing across threads. Rather than touch a peer's pool, a
remote free is pushed onto the owner's lock-free MPSC stack — threaded through
the freed block's own memory, so it costs no extra storage — and the owner
reclaims it on its next allocation:

$$ \text{push:}\;\; n.\text{next} \leftarrow \text{head};\;\; \mathrm{CAS}(\text{head},\, n.\text{next},\, n) \qquad \text{drain:}\;\; \text{batch} \leftarrow \mathrm{exchange}(\text{head},\, \varnothing) $$

Ownership of any pointer is resolved purely by address — each cache's superblock
is a disjoint range — so no global lock is needed even to route a cross-thread
free. The whole layer is verified race-free under ThreadSanitizer.

**Fig. 4 — Aggregate throughput vs. thread count (1–8).** memalloc tracks the
ideal-linear reference far more closely than the system allocator, and leads at
every thread count.

| Threads | memalloc (M ops/s) | system (M ops/s) | ideal-linear |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| 1 | 28.4 | 16.8 | 28.4 |
| 2 | 62.8 | 31.5 | 56.8 |
| 4 | 116.6 | 54.8 | 113.6 |
| 8 | 187.2 | 103.6 | 227.2 |

## 05 · Fragmentation & stability

TLSF's second level is what bounds internal waste. Subdividing each power-of-two
class into `SL = 32` linear bins caps the rounding error a request can suffer,
independent of size:

$$ \frac{\text{internal waste}}{\text{block size}} \;<\; \frac{1}{\mathrm{SL}} \;=\; \frac{1}{32} \;\approx\; 3.1\% $$

Measured over the variable-size workload, immediate coalescing keeps real
fragmentation far below even that bound — and well under the 3% target.

**Fig. 5 — Fragmentation (engine footprint vs. requested bytes) over the
variable-size workload, against the 3% target.** It settles at **0.24%**.

Determinism must also survive time. Across more than ten thousand continuous
allocate/free cycles the resident footprint reaches a plateau and stays there —
no creep, no leak, no late-cycle slowdown.

**Fig. 6 — Resident footprint across 12,000 cycles.** Memory plateaus
immediately and holds flat at **4.3 MB** — recycled slots are reused in place, so
steady-state churn commits nothing new.

**Tbl. 2 — PRD targets vs. measured results** (● met · ○ not met). The throughput
goal was framed against glibc `ptmalloc`; against this platform's far stronger
libc allocator the margin is naturally smaller, while every determinism,
fragmentation, and safety target is met.

| | PRD target | Goal | Measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| ● | Worst-case time complexity | O(1) | O(1) — flat across 16 B–64 KB |
| ○ | Throughput vs system malloc | ≥6× (vs glibc) | 1.2–4.5× (vs Apple libc) |
| ● | Memory fragmentation | <3% | 0.24% |
| ● | Latency determinism (tail) | tight p99.9 | p99.9 167 ns vs malloc 1.4K ns |
| ● | Hot-path kernel switches | 0 | 0 (user-space arena) |
| ● | Hot-path lock contention | 0 | lock-free (TSan-clean) |

## Colophon

Allocator and benchmarks are C++17 (no third-party allocator code). Every figure
comes from a live run — `export_data.py` replays the synthetic HFT trace through
both allocators and writes `data.json`, which this page renders with hand-rolled
SVG and KaTeX before headless Chrome prints it. No numbers are hand-entered.

```sh
# reproduce every figure in this note
cmake --preset release && cmake --build --preset release
ctest --preset release        # 74 tests, also green under asan / tsan
./site/build_pdf.sh           # run metrics → data.json → research-note.pdf
```

Baseline is the host's system `malloc`; results are hardware- and OS-dependent
and reflect a best-of-N run to suppress scheduler noise. Sub-41 ns latencies sit
below the host timer's granularity and are reported as such.
